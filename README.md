# 🛡️ SOC Threat Hunting with Splunk – Labs & Detection Techniques

This repository documents my hands-on threat hunting labs using **Splunk Enterprise** based on the course **"SOC Cybersecurity Threat Hunting with Splunk"** by Mohammad Mirasadollahi.

The labs simulate real-world attack scenarios and use Splunk to detect and analyze adversary techniques aligned with **MITRE ATT&CK**.
